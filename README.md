## COMP30050 Final Project
This is our version of a dynamic, procedural generation of Monopoly, through Java.

Owing to the fact that we had to completely refactor our code, we decided to make a new folder containing the code for submission.

The folder labelled final_project is the folder we are sending for submission, from Monopoly/src/final_project.

The game is run using the Board class.

We also decided to include the code we were using, as well as the interfaces and enums we would be implementing and integrating for the final project, so as the evaluators can see what we had planned on using before half the team dropped out last minute.

A NOCList class was implmented but there was no time to implement it to the game.

To run the game DOWNLOAD THE JAR FILE AND RUN IT FROM THERE / PULL THE CODE FROM THE GITHUB AND USE THE BOARD CLASS TO RUN.

# Codebase
Each class submitted contains relevant logic for controlling the various functionality of the game, as follows Board contains the UI and main class. The Players class handles all things related to the player such as the balance and other getter and setter methods. Commands relates to how the game interacts with all the commands that are possible from the game.
